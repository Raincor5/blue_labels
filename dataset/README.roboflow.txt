The dataset includes 253 images.
Product-labels are annotated in YOLOv8 Oriented Object Detection format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise
* Random exposure adjustment of between -8 and +8 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 1.4 pixels
